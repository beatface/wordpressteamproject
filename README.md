# wordpressteamproject

An NSS group project by Emma Beaton, Danielle Hollis, and Tina Wisneski.


This project is based on the Wordpress theme, Xylus. Our goal was to copy the theme as closely as possible, carry that design between all three pages, and each work on content for a page. We worked with git to create branches, pull and merge files, and load onto GitHub.
